# DabloonBot

## Overview
The *Dabloon Bot* or *Bank of Dabloons* is a Discord bot where users can
post and claim bounties for **dabloons**, or any other fictitious currencies. 
Bounties are usually comprised of some short challenge such as creating a themed
drawing, or taking a picture of your pet. Upon completing a bounty, the user
will be awarded with **dabloons**, which can be held for bragging rights or exchanged with your
friends for favors.

## Setup
This project uses the `discord` (also known as *discord py*) and the `python-dotenv` 
libraries. To run the bot, you will need to acquire [a bot token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/), as well
as granting the bot full administrative privileges within the server in the *[Discord developer portal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj9puaP1oX_AhXbJkQIHYsDCa8QjBB6BAgbEAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Fdevelopers%2Fdocs%2Fgame-sdk%2Fapplications&usg=AOvVaw3b3k10Sxsuc8oMzbYe7LXZ)*. *(When 1.0 is launched,
administrative privileges will not be required.)* Then, using the URL generator in the developer portal, 
add the bot to your server. 

Next, create a `.env` file in the same directory as `main.py`. On the first line, write
`DISCORD_TOKEN = "[DISCORD TOKEN HERE]"`. You should then be able to run the bot by using `python3 main.py` in the terminal.

## Usage
